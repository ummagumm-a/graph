# Graph
Adjacency Matrix Graph Implementation

It was a homework in DSA course in Innopolis University

Here you can see an implementation of a graph with basic operation on graphs.

Also, functions to check whether graph is asyclic, performing DFS, calculating total weight of edges on a path, transposition, finding shortest path between two vertices requirement for minimum bandwidth of edges on the path.
